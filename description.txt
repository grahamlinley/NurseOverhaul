You ever feel like when you're fighting a boss, it would be nice to have a signal to the Nurse to heal you as you pass by. Maybe you've thought this as you've played aim simulator as the Devourer of Gods comes barreling at your base at a cool 300 miles per hour. 

This mod solves that. Simply adds a keybind so that you can automatically heal when you're in range to talk to the Nurse. Be careful, she's a money grubber. Wouldn't press that button too many times...
