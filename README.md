Nurse Overhaul

This mod adds 3 main functions to the Nurse:

1. Hotkey for healing + items earned through progression that increase this hotkey's range
2. Recipes to bridge the gap between lesser/regular healing potions and the later potions, and additonal options to craft later potions
3. A shop for the Nurse where she sells most types of healing potions, if not all

Fully compatible with Calamity. 1.4.4 published. Uses BossChecklist for stronger references to Calamity bosses.


Things to note: 

A buff will appear on your character when you are in range of being healed. Numbers should always be accurate to the number you see on the Nurse, but since what you are being charged
is manually coded, if you find a situation where the quick heal doesn't match up to the price or some other weird situation, let me know and I can fix it.

Added recipes are balanced against in game recipes.

If there are healing related items people would find useful to be added to the shop, leave a comment and I'll see if I should add. An old Nurse Shop had Life Crystal's and Life 
Fruit, but I wasn't a huge fan of that so I skipped those in this mod.

There are also old idea's floating around for a more comprehensive overhaul including quests to kill certain monsters reset every Terraria day and medically inspired combat items.
If that sounds cool leave a comment


Special Thanks

Big thanks to the legendary NotLe0n for letting me use his UI/UISystem to draw the Nurse's shop. Core functionality was lifted from his mod AnglerShop, would definitely check it out
if you aren't a huge fan of fishing.

Shout out to another legend, jopojelly, for helping me figure out how to automatially adjust my manual pricing based on the Nurse's happiness. Insane to see that absolute madlad still
out in the forums and in the discord trenches answering all our lowly questions, so mad respect to them. 

Gotta mention my boy TheEdster3 for walking with me through the beginning of my journey on this project, decompiling Terraria and planting the fertile seed that would one day become
Nurse Overhaul. He left me with a heal that max healed every game tick you were next to the Nurse and now we're here.
