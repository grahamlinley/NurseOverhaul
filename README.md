Nurse Overhaul

This mod adds 3 main functions to the Nurse:

1. Hotkey for healing + items earned through progression that increase this hotkey's range
2. Recipes to bridge the gap between lesser/regular healing potions and the later potions, and additional options to craft later potions
3. A shop for the Nurse where she sells most types of healing potions, if not all

Fully compatible with Calamity. 1.4.4 published. Uses BossChecklist for stronger references to Calamity bosses.


Things to note:

You need to bind quick heal to a button manually in the Settings -> Controls -> Mod Controls menu.

IF YOU ARE PLAYING CALAMITY: Prices when fighting a boss are 5x what they are normally, so be careful. Also, the base heal cost increases by a flat amount depending on which 
bosses you have defeated.

For the Nurse quick heal at range items, King Slime, Eye of Cthulhu, and Brain of Cthulhu/Eater of Worlds all drop component items to upgrade the base Nurse VIP Badge which is sold 
in the Nurse's shop. You will also be able to buy these items from her shop as you progress, however it is significantly cheaper to build by just killing the bosses. 

A buff will appear on your character when you are in range of being healed. Numbers should always be accurate to the number you see on the Nurse, but since what you are being charged
is manually coded, if you find a situation where the quick heal doesn't match up to the price or some other weird situation, let me know and I can fix it.

Added recipes are balanced against in game recipes.

Unlike Nurse Shop, items are not unlocked in stage progression and rather each item is unlocked by killing individual bosses. What this means: If you kill King Slime, the Nurse will 
start selling Healing Potions. If you kill Eye of Cthulhu and not King Slime, Restoration Potion and the Nurse's Walkie Talkie will be unlocked but Healing Potion won't. Here is a
full list of the items that the Nurse will sell and their unlock conditions:

None: Mushroom, Bottled Water, Bottled Honey, Lesser Healing Potion

King Slime: Healing Potion

Eye of Cthulhu: Restoration Potion, Nurse Walkie Talkie

Brain of Cthulhu/Eater of Worlds: Surface Transponder

Skeletron: Platinum Insurance

Wall of Flesh: Lifeforce Potion, Greater Healing Potion

Ancient Cultist: Super Healing Potion


If there are healing related items people would find useful to be added to the shop, leave a comment and I'll see if I should add. An old Nurse Shop had Life Crystal's and Life 
Fruit, but I wasn't a huge fan of that so I skipped those in this mod.

There are also old idea's floating around for a more comprehensive overhaul including quests to kill certain monsters reset every Terraria day and medically inspired combat items.
If that sounds cool leave a comment


Special Thanks

Huge thanks to the legendary NotLe0n for letting me use his UI/UISystem to draw the Nurse's shop. Core functionality was lifted from his mod AnglerShop, would definitely check it out
if you aren't a big fan of fishing.

Shout out to another legend, jopojelly, for helping me figure out how to automatically adjust my manual pricing based on the Nurse's happiness. Insane to see that absolute madlad still
out in the forums and in the discord trenches answering all our lowly questions, so mad respect to them. 

Also shout out to ThomasthePencil for figuring out the 1.4.4 shop indexing during the preview. Thought about giving up porting until others had figured it out but I saw that he asked
the same question I had in the tModLoader Discord and he linked me the code for his project Dialect which helped me figure out mine. 

Gotta mention my boy TheEdster3 for walking with me through the beginning of my journey on this project, decompiling Terraria and planting the fertile seed that would one day become
Nurse Overhaul. He left me with a heal that max healed every game tick you were next to the Nurse and now we're here.

And thanks to the community in general for having so many resources. A lot of work is put into tModLoader and its supporting documentation.
